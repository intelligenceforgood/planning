# Milestone 2 – Target GCP Architecture

_Last updated: 7 Nov 2025_

Use this outline to track prep and execution tasks for Milestone 2 (designing the future-state i4g architecture on GCP).

## 1. Prep & Inputs
- Re-read `planning/migration_plan.md` Milestone 2 goals.
- Refresh `planning/future_architecture.md` and note sections that need deeper detail (data flows, IAM, component choices).
- Inventory current DT-IFG Azure components (functions, storage accounts, SQL schema) from `planning/system_review.md` for reference.
- Collect existing diagrams (if any) and decide whether to redraw in Excalidraw, CloudCraft, or Mermaid.

## 2. Workstreams
1. **Architecture Diagrams**
   - Draft updated logical and deployment diagrams showing Cloud Run, Firestore, Cloud Storage, retrieval layer, IAM.
   - Highlight managed vs. open/self-hosted options per capability.
   - ✅ High-level Mermaid topology committed 2025-11-07; refine with component swimlanes if needed.

2. **Data Flow Narratives**
   - Document ingestion pathways (forms, groups.io, financial feeds) into Firestore/Storage.
   - Describe retrieval/RAG flow including vector store selection and LLM hosting.
   - Cover report generation pipeline and its interactions with stores and LLMs.
   - ✅ Initial workflows captured in `future_architecture.md` §3.10.

3. **Capability Replacement Matrix**
   - Map each Azure component to a proposed GCP substitute with rationale, trade-offs, and open-source alignment.
   - Call out decisions requiring PoC validation (Vertex AI Search vs AlloyDB + pgvector, IdP choice, etc.).
   - ✅ Draft matrix committed in `future_architecture.md` §4.

4. **Security & IAM Plan**
   - Define service accounts, Secret Manager usage, tokenization/PII controls.
   - Outline Workload Identity Federation needs during transition.

5. **Outstanding Decisions Register**
   - Update the table in `planning/future_architecture.md` with owners and due dates as decisions solidify.

## 3. Deliverables Checklist
- [ ] Updated `planning/future_architecture.md` with revised diagrams (Mermaid draft added 2025-11-07; extend as needed).
- [ ] Appendix or inline section documenting managed vs local profiles for each capability.
- [ ] Summary paragraph for change_log once Milestone 2 design is approved.

## 4. Open Questions
- Do we need stakeholder interviews to confirm ingestion requirements? If yes, schedule or assign owner.
- What sample workload do we need for retrieval PoC comparisons?

Keep this outline updated as tasks progress; it will serve as the persistent prompt for Milestone 2 work sessions.
