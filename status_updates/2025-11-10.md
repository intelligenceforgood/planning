# Status Update — 10 Nov 2025 (Milestone 2 Kickoff)

**Timebox**: 2025-10-20 → 2025-11-10 (Weeks 1–3 of Milestone 2)

**Contributor availability**: ~10 hrs/week (Jerry)

## Highlights
- Deployed FastAPI and Streamlit services to Cloud Run, verified end-to-end smoke tests (queue seed/read, analyst UI actions) and documented the manual `gcloud run services update …` workflow for reusing container tags.
- Implemented Terraform modules for service accounts and GitHub Workload Identity Federation; CI workflow now runs `terraform fmt/plan/apply` against the dev environment without long-lived keys.
- Finalised the local sandbox profile (`I4G_ENV=local`) plus bootstrap script and refreshed developer docs so newcomers can reproduce demo data and pipelines quickly.
- Expanded planning artifacts: change log now captures Cloud Run deployment and IAM automation; Milestone 2 task outline reflects current status across architecture, security, and sandbox streams.

## In Flight
- Refining Milestone 2 logical & deployment diagrams with Cloud Run, scheduler, and dataflow swimlanes.
- Extending IAM/Terraform scaffolding so the `i4g-dev` pattern can be duplicated to `i4g-prod` when we flip the switch; documenting required repo/environment variables.
- Populating the Outstanding Decisions register with owners, due dates, and next actions (retrieval backend choice, IdP selection, ingestion sequencing).
- Preparing retrieval PoCs (Vertex AI Search vs. AlloyDB + pgvector) and the evaluation harness needed to judge relevance/latency.

## Risks / Blockers
- Retrieval PoCs remain gated on evaluation metrics and dataset definition; if we pick the wrong tech stack we may need to backtrack.
- Outstanding Decisions register still lacks concrete target dates; without them the architecture review may drift and cause rework.

## Next 2–3 Weeks
- Finish architecture visuals (component swimlanes, managed vs. open profiles) and publish in `future_architecture.md`.
- Populate the Outstanding Decisions table and circulate for sanity-check before locking design choices.
- Stand up first retrieval PoC and capture baseline metrics for stakeholder feedback.
- Draft `i4g-prod` Terraform/WIF extension plan so we can clone the dev pipeline once the production project is provisioned.

## Requests / Decisions Needed
- If you have suggestions or questions, message Jerry on Signal; otherwise we will continue executing against the current design.
- Internal: lock retrieval evaluation criteria and acceptable baseline relevance scores to avoid rework.
- Internal: confirm Google Identity Platform remains the target IdP before deeper prototyping efforts.
