# Status Update — 6 Nov 2025 (Milestone 2 Kickoff)

**Timebox**: 2025-10-20 → 2025-11-06 (Weeks 1–2 of Milestone 2)

**Contributor availability**: ~10 hrs/week (Jerry)

## Highlights
- Captured DT-IFG system review and confirmed Azure + GCP hybrid dependencies.
- Published Milestone 2 planning artifacts: migration plan, gap analysis, future architecture, technology evaluation, implementation roadmap.
- Adjusted implementation roadmap to a 16-week pacing reference aligned with current capacity.

## In Flight
- Standing up retrieval PoCs (Vertex AI Search vs AlloyDB pgvector) and defining evaluation metrics/dataset.
- Drafting identity provider decision matrix comparing Google Identity Platform and authentik, including security implications.
- Mapping Azure ingestion jobs to GCP equivalents (Cloud Run Jobs + Cloud Scheduler) and identifying missing documentation.

## Risks / Blockers
- Chat/RAG parity depends on successful retrieval PoCs; quality metrics and evaluation harness still pending.
- Ingestion migration scope partially unknown until Azure workflow docs are fully parsed.
- Limited volunteer capacity means delays in one stream may cascade—milestone pacing will be reassessed after Milestone 2 outputs are delivered.

## Next 2–3 Weeks
- Complete retrieval PoC setup and capture initial relevance/latency metrics for stakeholder review.
- Prototype Google Identity Platform integration with FastAPI/Streamlit skeleton to validate auth flow.
- Inventory Azure ingestion job triggers and draft equivalent GCP scheduler diagrams/runbooks.

## Requests / Decisions Needed
- Stakeholder input on retrieval evaluation criteria and acceptable relevance baseline.
- Confirmation of priority ingestion pipelines for early migration focus.
