# 2025-11-18 Status Update

## Highlights
- Restored the dev intake smoke workflow: rebuilt the `intake-job:dev` image, updated the Cloud Run job configuration, and executed the end-to-end run (API submission → Cloud Run job → processed intake) successfully.
- Reworked `docs/smoke_test.md` to separate local and GCP scenarios, adding precise Cloud Run steps so future smoke passes require only dynamic intake identifiers.
- Captured the configuration drift fixes in the change log and verified that Cloud Run logs now show successful status updates instead of 404 churn.

## In Flight
- Monitoring for any follow-up fixes once prod Terraform applies incorporate the new job environment variables.
- Coordinating with infra to ensure the ingestion pipeline’s vector toggle remains disabled until the managed embedding service is ready.

## Risks
- Remote smoke coverage still depends on manual job execution; automation remains a to-do and could delay detection of regressions.
- If the dev FastAPI gateway rotates tokens without notice, the documented `dev-analyst-token` may fail and block the scripted workflow.

## Next Steps
- Automate the dev smoke workflow (triggering intake submission and job execution) via a lightweight script or Cloud Build job.
- Mirror the documented Cloud Run env var adjustments in prod once the next deployment window opens.

## Requests
- None at this time.
