# Status Update Index

This folder tracks status summaries for the DT-IFG → i4g migration. Updates are written every 2–3 weeks and stored as individual markdown files named by date (`YYYY-MM-DD.md`).

## Updates
- [2025-11-06 Status Update](2025-11-06.md)

## How to add a new update
1. Create a new file named with the report date (e.g., `2025-11-27.md`).
2. Add the update using the standard sections (Highlights, In Flight, Risks, Next Steps, Requests).
3. Append a link to the new file under **Updates** in this index, keeping most recent entries at the top.
