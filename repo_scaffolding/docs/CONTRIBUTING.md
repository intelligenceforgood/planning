# Contributing to the Documentation Site

## Workflow
1. Open an issue for new sections or major edits.
2. Create a feature branch for your changes.
3. Run the documentation site locally to confirm formatting (commands will depend on MkDocs vs Docusaurus).
4. Submit a pull request with screenshots (if visual changes) and a brief summary.

## Content Guidelines
- Write in inclusive, volunteer-friendly language.
- Keep sections short and link to deeper technical docs when needed.
- Ensure any diagrams have source files committed (e.g., `.drawio`, `.svg`).

## Review Checklist
- Spelling and grammar checked.
- Navigation updated if new pages are added.
- Links verified.
