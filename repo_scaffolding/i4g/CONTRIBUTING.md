# Contributing Guidelines

Thanks for your interest in supporting Intelligence for Good! Until Milestone 2 completes, contributions focus on planning, evaluations, and preparing production scaffolding.

## Before You Start
- Review the active migration milestones and roadmap.
- Open an issue for new work so we can confirm scope and priority.
- For prototype experiments, use the `intelligenceforgood/proto` repository.

## Development Workflow
1. Fork the repository (or create a feature branch if you have direct access).
2. Create a virtual environment and install dependencies once service code lands.
3. Follow the project coding standards (Black + isort for Python; lint rules will be added to CI).
4. Run tests locally before opening a pull request.
5. Submit a PR with:
   - Brief summary of changes and motivation.
   - Linked issue or milestone reference.
   - Notes on testing performed and any follow-up tasks.

## Communication
- Status updates every 2–3 weeks are published in the planning repository (`planning/status_updates/`).
- Use GitHub discussions or issues for architectural proposals and questions.

## License
Contributions will be licensed under the MIT License. By submitting a contribution, you agree to that license.
